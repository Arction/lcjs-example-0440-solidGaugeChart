-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

## Description

This example shows solid gauge chart.

The chart can be created with a simple line of code.

```javascript
// Create a new Gauge chart.
const gauge = lightningChart().Gauge({ type: GaugeChartTypes.Solid })
```

After creating the Gauge Chart the value for it can be set simply.

```javascript
gauge
    // Get default slice, this is the only slice there is and
    // it should be manipulated to set wanted value to the Gauge Chart.
    .getDefaultSlice()
    // Set start and end values.
    .setInterval(0, 400000)
    // Set the displayed value.
    .setValue(329000)
```
